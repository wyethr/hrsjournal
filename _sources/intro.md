### Our Mission

The Marlborough Academic Research Society *(MARS)* aims to provide Marlborough students from all backgrounds with the opportunity to edit, refine, and publish their research. By facilitating robust discussions across a diverse range of academic fields, and by teaching students how to navigate the peer review process, *MARS* hopes to prepare Marlborough students for future scholarly research and publication. *MARS* also looks to challenge and amplify existing knowledge, through the dissemination of quality research in the sciences, social sciences, and  humanities.

### Our History

*MARS* was founded in 2023. The original Honors Research journal - *Eureka!* - first appeared in print in 2013, edited by Dr. Elizabeth Ashforth, the then head of Marlborough's Honors Research in Science. From 2014 through 2017, four print issues of *Eureka!* showcased students' Honors Research projects. Six years later, seniors Eli and Wyeth brought *MARS* online to include Marlborough students outside of Honors Research, and to give students firsthand experience with the peer review process. It is now an entirely student-led publication, with student researchers, editors, and peer reviewers highlighting Marlborough students' academic scholarship.

#### *What is the Honors Research program?* 

Honors Research in Science was first developed by Dr. Arleen Forsheit in 1994 as a way for students to expand their work in science beyond the classroom. In 2007, the Leonetti/O’Connell Family Endowed Fund was established to support the Honors Research in Science Program, and in 2013, the Leonetti/O’Connell Family Foundation expanded its generosity to include the Honors Research in Humanities and Social Sciences Program. 

The Leonetti/O’Connell Honors Research Program provides students with the opportunity to define, design, and conduct original research across the sciences, humanities, and social sciences under the mentorship of an academic expert in the field. Past mentors have included local scholars from UCLA, USC and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, and mentors from as far away as Harvard University, Stanford University, Georgetown University, and the London School of Economics. Pushed beyond our AP curriculum, this program challenges our students to gain early fluency in scholarly reading and writing, produce relevant and valuable research, and learn to communicate their results at a professional level. Students participate in TEDxMarlborough, which allows them to bring their research informally to the community through a series of lunchtime talks, and also the annual Celebration of Innovation, which allows them to summarize their year long research projects into a formal poster presentation.
