:class: abstract

Victor Hugo’s *Les Misérables* is the world’s most frequently adapted novel, but remarkably few of its many adaptations successfully convey the importance of the 1832 June Rebellion. Not only is the rebellion the novel’s dramatic climax, it is the culmination of its political ideals: its presence is key to understanding the plot, structure, and message of the story as a whole. When its role is minimized in adaptation to accommodate the novel’s other storylines, audience members often come away with an incomplete understanding of the rebellion and the message behind it. This paper examines the different strategies used to simplify and adapt the rebellion for stage and screen, aiming to determine how the significance of the June Rebellion can be most effectively communicated to modern day audiences. In order to condense Hugo’s multifaceted rebellion, adapters tend to focus on just one angle so that audiences gain a clear idea of on what terms they are meant to relate to the insurgents and their ideals. Most adaptations of *Les Misérables* justify the rebellion either through clearly communicating the historical and political context that motivated the insurgents, or through encouraging their audience to empathize with the insurgents on an individual, emotional level, while certain others fail entirely to provoke audience sympathy from either angle. The more an adaptation is able to balance both logical and emotional justifications in its depiction of the rebellion, the closer it gets to communicating Hugo’s intentions to the audience and effectively transposing *Les Misérables* for the modern day viewer.
