## Letter from the Heads of the Leonetti/O'Connell Honors Research Program

Dear Readers,

Welcome to the first edition of MARS, our student research journal! It's a privilege to present the culmination of our students' hard work and intellectual curiosity.

Within these articles, you'll find a diverse range of topics and perspectives, showcasing the depth of understanding and passion for exploration among our contributors. Our journal serves as a platform for emerging scholars to engage in meaningful discourse and showcase their work. We invite you to approach each article with an open mind and critical eye, enriching the scholarly dialogue.

Thank you to our authors, reviewers, and editorial team for their dedication. An extra special shout out to Eli Lerner, whose vision and innovation brought this idea to the table, and to Wyeth Renwick, for her dedication to bringing this idea to life. And to you, our readers, thank you for your support and engagement in celebrating student scholarship.

Best, 

Dr. Allison Ponzio
Director of the Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation
Leonetti/O'Connell Honors Research in Science Program Head
