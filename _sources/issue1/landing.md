### Letter from Dr. Ponzio

Dear Readers,

Welcome to the first edition of *MARS,* our student research journal! It's a privilege to present the culmination of our students' hard work and intellectual curiosity.

Within these articles, you'll find a diverse range of topics and perspectives, showcasing the depth of understanding and passion for exploration among our contributors. Our journal serves as a platform for emerging scholars to engage in meaningful discourse and showcase their work. We invite you to approach each article with an open mind and critical eye, enriching the scholarly dialogue.

Thank you to our authors, reviewers, and editorial team for their dedication. An extra special shout out to Eli Lerner, whose vision and innovation brought this idea to the table, and to Wyeth Renwick, for her dedication to bringing this idea to life. And to you, our readers, thank you for your support and engagement in celebrating student scholarship.

Best, 

Dr. Allison Ponzio

Director of the Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation

Leonetti/O'Connell Honors Research in Science Program Head

### Letter from Dr. Lynch

Dear Readers,

Congratulations to the *MARS* staff for the launch of this website and the inaugural issue. They have accomplished so much in a limited timeframe and established a strong foundation for Marlborough researchers to build on in the years ahead.

Eli Lerner spearheaded the journal idea from its inception, surveying similar publications, meeting with faculty across several departments for advice and feedback, and outlining and implementing the initial plans to get the project off the ground. Wyeth Renwick also played an indispensable role by creating the website to house the journal under the guidance of Dr. Darren Kessner. The inspiration and persistence shown by these editors-in-chief was matched by the other members of the dream team that came together to edit and shape the first issue and the protocols for the journal going forward: Sally Cheng, Mattie Epstein, Victoria Perry, and Lauren Vick. They all deserve immense credit, as do Violet Affleck, Percy Liftin-Harris, and Lior Ronen, who, along with Eli and Lauren, stepped up to contribute and revise their first-rate papers for publication, while offering constructive feedback on each other's work.

What a great privilege it has been to watch this student-led initiative come to fruition!

Best, 

Dr. Dan Lynch

Leonetti/O'Connell Honors Research in Humanities and Social Sciences Program Head
