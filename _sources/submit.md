# Submission Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in submitting a paper to *MARS,* Marlborough’s student-run academic journal. Here is some important information to consider before submitting your article.

## Author Guidelines

### Eligibility

*MARS* accepts papers of all different academic fields and disciplines, written by chief authors in grades 9-12. While *MARS* is closely affiliated with the Honors Research program, eligible papers may be produced for any class, or they can be independent research projects. 

*MARS* only accepts polished drafts of papers, not project proposals. Any alternative forms of research will not be reviewed. 

### Expectations

Accepted authors will receive feedback and make edits to their paper according to the recommendations of the journal staff. They will also be expected to undergo a short training on the peer review process, read one other student’s paper, and attend a meeting with *MARS* staff editors to discuss revisions to that paper. See below for more information on the peer review process.

## Content Guidelines

Papers must be **proof-read** for grammar mistakes, and they must employ the thorough use of **peer-reviewed, scholarly sources** as well as **proper citations.** All secondary sources must be peer-reviewed or scholarly. Papers must be written for an audience of scholars with expertise in your discipline. However, for the sake of the *MARS* student editors, please define any particularly niche words or ideas.

Each article published online is also expected to include 
- a **150-250 word abstract,** summarizing the premise, methods, and conclusions of the paper. For more information on writing a thorough abstract, see [this](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/assignments/writing-an-abstract-for-your-research-paper/) resource. 
- a **complete bibliography section.** See below on expectations for references.
- a **headshot** of the author, along with their institutional affiliation(s). For guidelines on a proper headshot, see [this](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/registration/online-registration/photo-requirements) resource.

If the paper was written for Honors Research, authors may also opt to publish on their author page
- their **TEDxMarlborough recording**
- their **poster** for the Celebration of Innovation

While we will review papers of any length (within reason), they must generally not exceed **10,000 words,** excluding their bibliography and abstract. An optional **acknowledgements section** may accompany the paper and will not be included in the word count.

## Formatting Guidelines

Here is a [sample article](sample.pdf) off of which you can base your formatting.

Each submission must have a **title page** including 
- full title of the paper
- the name, institutional affiliation, and grade of the primary author in the year that the paper was written
- the title, role, and institutional affiliation(s) of any mentors/co-authors
- if applicable, the title of the class for which the paper was produced

Papers must be submitted as a Google Doc. Expectations are that the article is formatted with 
- double spacing
- 1.5 inch margins
- 12 point Times New Roman font
- numbered pages
- bolded section titles

### Citations

Citations must be submitted in the citation method consistent with the field of study of the paper (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.). All quotations, paraphrases, and references to other works must be cited. If you are unsure of whether or not a citation is needed, see [this](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html) guide, or reach out to a *MARS* editor.

### Figures

Submit all figures in a numbered appendix at the end of your article. All figures must be of high resolution, and are expected to be accompanied by an appropriate figure caption.

## Peer Review

At *MARS,* one of our core goals is to give students experience with the peer-review process. This is an invaluable experience, both for our student editors, and for the authors themselves. Thus, we expect all authors to engage in the peer-review process, on both ends. **Should your paper be accepted, we also expect that you will aid in revising another student’s paper for publication.** We will train you on how to uphold *MARS* editing standards before you begin editing another’s work.

Because we hold the peer review process to be extremely important, we will not publish papers without revisions. Receiving criticism is an incredibly useful skill, and we will be as constructive and compassionate as possible when suggesting revisions. We realize that we are not faultless, and you are welcome to reach out to our editors-in-chief, or our faculty advisors Dr. Ponzio and Dr. Lynch, with any concerns.

Though most professional journals employ double-blind peer review, this is not feasible in a high school setting. Both authors and reviewers will be aware of each others’ identities. We understand that it may be uncomfortable to leave your work in the hands of student editors. We can assure you that all *MARS* reviewers have previous research experience, have undergone training on the peer review process, and are under the supervision of *MARS* editors-in-chiefs. 

## Next Steps

After submission, you can expect an email response from one of the *MARS* editors within 1-3 weeks, informing you of whether your paper has been accepted with revisions or rejected. **No papers will be accepted without revisions.**  


1. Upon submission, at least one editor will read every paper, and all subject editors will read every abstract before meeting to decide whether to accept or reject the submission. 
2. After a paper is accepted, it will be revised by three *MARS* staff members, including an editor-in-chief, along with one student author. 
3. All editors and peer reviewers will meet to discuss their revisions before sending a new version of the paper with suggested edits via email. 
4. Authors will be in contact with one of the editors who worked on their paper, should they have any questions in implementing feedback, before submitting their finalized papers for publication. Authors are not expected to accept every revision. 
5. Each paper will be read over for a third and final time by an editor-in-chief before publication. 
6. The first issue will be released at the Celebration of Innovation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will publishing in *MARS* impede future publication?

One of *MARS*’s primary missions is to support student authors submitting their work to professional scholarly journals. If you are one such student, please indicate so on your submission form. This will allow us to contact you with further resources, such as assistance in selecting a target journal, or writing a cover letter. 

This is also important information considering the intellectual ownership of your paper. Generally, you must be allowed to publish your work online under the journal’s personal use policy. However, researchers must **always check** the submission guidelines of the journal to which they are submitting, and it is best practice to notify that journal before publishing the same paper with *MARS.* We understand that some students may be uncomfortable publishing their work with *MARS* for that reason, and we would still wish to extend our aid in the editing process on the path to publication. We can work with you to publish alternative forms of research (abstract, poster, literature review, TEDxMarlborough recording, etc.) on the *MARS* website, so that you still get to experience the peer review process without publishing your full paper online. 

Remember that the decision to submit to any journal (whether it be *MARS* or elsewhere) must be made with the permission of any and all co-authors.

- [Internet posting guidelines](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/internet-posting-guidelines) (American Psychological Association)  

### Can I publish anonymously?

We do publish work anonymously, but **only with prior approval** from Dr. Lynch and Dr. Ponzio. Please let us know if you are uncomfortable with having your name and/or face attached to your article, as it will be posted publicly on the *MARS* website. 

### Conflicts of interest?

We expect that authors reveal any conflicts of interest in a written statement on the title page of their initial submission, or else state that they have none.

### Use of AI?

While use is discourage, we do not strictly disallow the use of AI in the research process. However, we do ask that authors disclose the use of AI to the editors, along with an explanation of how AI was used.

### Use of human subjects?

Any paper utilizing human subjects must have prior approval through the Marlborough Institutional Review Board, or other appropriate authorities.

### Third party material and copyright?

Authors need not concern themselves with obtaining permission from copyright owners when making primary submissions. Most scholarly research is protected from copyright infringement under the Fair Use Act. *MARS* staff will inform authors of any potential copyright infringement hazards before publication. See [this](https://guides.library.cornell.edu/ld.php?content_id=63936868) checklist to see whether Fair Use applies, as well as [this](https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/publishing-your-research/moving-through-production/copyright-for-journal-authors/) guide to copyright from Taylor and Francis.


### Who counts as a co-author? 

If you are unclear as to what contributions constitute co-authorship, see [this](https://research.fas.harvard.edu/links/guidelines-authorship-and-acknowledgement) resource. If you do have any co-authors, we must have their written permission to post your paper, with their name attached, on the *MARS* website before we can publish it.
