*Eureka!* was resurrected in 2024 to publish Marlborough students' research. Its inaugural issue was published in 2013, edited by Dr. Elizabeth Ashforth, the then head of Marlborough's Honors Research in Science. Through 2014 and 2017, four issues of *Eureka!* showcased students' Honors Research projects. In 2024, Eli and Wyeth brought *Eureka!* online to expand the journal's mission in publishing Marlborough students' research outside of Honors Research, and to give students firsthand experience with the peer-review process. It is now an entirely student-led publication, with student researchers, editors, and peer reviewers highlighting Marlborough students' academic scholarship.
