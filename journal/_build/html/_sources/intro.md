*Eureka!* was resurrected in 2024 to publish Marlborough students' research. Its inaugural issue appeared in print in 2013, edited by Dr. Elizabeth Ashforth, the then head of Marlborough's Honors Research in Science. From 2014 through 2017, four print issues of *Eureka!* showcased students' Honors Research projects. Seven years later, seniors Eli and Wyeth brought *Eureka!* online to include Marlborough students outside of Honors Research, and to give students firsthand experience with the peer review process. It is now an entirely student-led publication, with student researchers, editors, and peer reviewers highlighting Marlborough students' academic scholarship.

#### *What is the cluster peer review system?* 

In the first semester, researchers are split into clusters, where each member of the cluster thoroughly reads and edits each of the other members' work. Through this system, students develop critical thinking and writing skills while learning how to edit their own work as well as that of others.

In the second semester, the *Eureka!* staff does final edits to standardize articles' formatting, grammar, and writing style.
