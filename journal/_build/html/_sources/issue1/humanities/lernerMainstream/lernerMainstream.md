:class: abstract

The comic book industry once possessed a clear dichotomy between a dominant mainstream and a subversive counterculture. However, with the advent of digital comics such as webcomics and webtoons, and the popularization of alternative comics, it is not entirely clear whether superhero comics still constitute the mainstream. This paper first utilizes pre-existing scholarship to theorize the concept of mainstream, identifying three key features that distinguish traditional mainstream and counterculture media: politically subversive stances, accessibility to large audiences, and perceived positioning in the broader cultural field. Then, the paper then performs a case study analysis of some of the most popular superhero comics, alternative comics, webcomics, and webtoons active in the year 2019. Using the three identified characteristics, this paper analyzes whether these comics clearly fit into traditional definitions of counterculture or mainstream. Finally, this paper concludes that traditional characteristics of both mainstream and counterculture are present in all of the comics explored in this research, with no comic falling neatly into either category. Thus, definitions of mainstream and counterculture must either be updated to account for a wider diversity of media or discarded as a relic of the past.
