:class: abstract

Current academic literature that comparatively assesses gender’s relationship with obscenity is limited. Some scholars examine profanity’s misogyny, others study slang’s evolution. What is missing then is a dynamic history of sexism in profanity — if slang changed, how has its relationship with women changed, too? *Genitalia in Slang (GIS)* is a database that aims to address this gap. By synthesizing over 600 primary sources, especially *Green’s Dictionary of Slang,* *GIS* compiles more than 1,400 British English slang terms — circa 640 for the male genitalia, 780 for the female — as well as almost 4,000 quotations of their usage before the twentieth century. Thanks to its legibility by computers, *GIS* can be used for a diverse range of studies, from those that zoom in only to examine one particular term to those that explore the development of over a thousand, from those that analyze a specific time period to those that span up to seven centuries. Through *GIS,* researchers can compare terms’ first and last recorded date of usage, gendered associations, and shifting connotations over time.  In doing so, *GIS* enables researchers to both quantitatively and qualitatively examine the development of a cultural taboo surrounding sex and sexual organs, as well as how that development played out differently for masculinized and feminized bodies in England.
