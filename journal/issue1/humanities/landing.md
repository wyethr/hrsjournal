## Letter from the Editor

Dear Readers,

We are excited to present the inaugural issue of the *MARS* journal. When Dr. Lynch approached me with the idea of creating a research journal at Marlborough, I was immediately intrigued. A huge amount of the work that Marlborough students do is learning how to write academic papers, and having a space to share that work is important. However, for me, the most important function of any student journal is the editing process. Learning how to write is one thing. Learning how to edit is something entirely different. Both skills are vital.

That is why *MARS* is more focused on the process than the product. Though we are lucky to have wonderful faculty advisors, Dr. Ponzio, Dr. Lynch, and Mx. Roby, *MARS* is fundamentally student-driven. Students occupy all roles of leadership at the journal. The editing process is not only managed by *MARS* staff, but also by contributing authors. This way, every student gets to experience both sides of the peer-review process: revising others’ work, and receiving feedback themselves.

I was overwhelmed by the abundance of student interest in this project. I want to express huge gratitude to this issue’s contributing authors, Violet Affleck, Percy Liftin-Harris, and Lior Ronen, who not only produced outstanding research, but also hours of work editing their papers for the sake of self-improvement rather than for an ‘A.’

Obviously, my co-editor-in-chief Wyeth Renwick deserves a huge amount of credit for bringing technical know-how and an inhuman work ethic to the journal. Without her, I doubt this project would have been remotely successful. And I cannot emphasize enough how impressed I have been with my fellow staff, Mattie Epstein, Sally Cheng, Lauren Vick, and Victoria Perry. They have contributed exciting new ideas to the table and a level of dedication that I have rarely seen. I am excited to see the new directions in which they take this journal next year, and cannot think of any students better equipped to lead it. 

Best,

Eli Lerner ‘24
