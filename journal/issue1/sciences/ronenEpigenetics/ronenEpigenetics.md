:class: abstract

Lior Ronen ‘24 has conducted a detailed literature review as part of the Honors Research in the Sciences program. In it, she begins to answer a question at the heart of modern epigenetics research: how do varying traumas that occur while a fetus is in utero continue to impact individuals into adulthood? She reviews existing scientific research on three important cases in which pregnant women were exposed to significant trauma: the Holocaust, the Dutch Famine, and 9/11. Overall, she finds that trauma endured by pregnant mothers impacts the gene expression of their fetuses in several different ways, causing an increased risk of mental illnesses such as PTSD and physical health crises later in life. These impacts vary significantly based on the nature of the traumatic event and the stage in gestation during which the traumatic event occurred. While Lior’s full paper is not quite ready, we are excited to share her research with you soon!
